    <h4>1. Good Karms Platform Connects Workers and Clients</h4>
    The Good Karms Platform is a web-based communications platform which enables the
    connection between Clients and Workers. “Clients” are individuals and/or businesses
    seeking to obtain services (“Job(s)”), and “Workers” are individuals and/or businesses
    seeking to perform Job(s) for Clients. Clients and Workers together are hereinafter
    referred to as “Users.” If you agree on the terms of a Job(s) with another User, you and
    such other User form a Service Agreement directly between the two of you as set forth
    in more detail below.
    COMPANY DOES NOT PERFORM JOB(S) AND DOES NOT EMPLOY INDIVIDUALS
    TO PERFORM JOB(S). COMPANY DOES NOT SUPERVISE, DIRECT OR CONTROL
    A WORKERS WORK OR THE JOB(S) IN ANY MANNER, WHICH WORKER HEREBY
    ACKNOWLEDGES.
    The Good Karms Platform only enables connections between Users for the fulfillment of
    Job(s). Company is not responsible for the performance of Users, nor does it have
    control over the quality, timing, legality, failure to provide, or any other aspect
    whatsoever of Job(s), Workers, Clients, nor of the integrity, responsibility, qualifications
    or any of the actions or omissions whatsoever of any Users. Company makes no
    representations about the suitability, reliability, timeliness, or accuracy of the Job(s)
    requested and services provided by Users identified through the Good Karms Platform
    whether in public, private, or offline interactions.
    <h4>2. User Vetting</h4>
    Users may be subject to an extensive vetting process before they can register for and
    during their use of the Good Karms Platform, including but not limited to a verification of
    identity and a comprehensive criminal background check, at the Country, State and
    local level, using third party services as appropriate. Users hereby give consent to
    Company to conduct background checks as often as required in compliance with federal
    and state laws, including, without limitation, the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
    Although Company may perform background checks of Users, as outlined above,
    Company cannot confirm that each User is who they claim to be and therefore,
    Company cannot and does not assume any responsibility for the accuracy or reliability
    of identity or background check information or any information provided through the
    Good Karms Platform.
    When interacting with other Users, you should exercise caution and common sense to
    protect your personal safety and property, just as you would when interacting with other
    persons whom you don’t know. NEITHER COMPANY NOR ITS AFFILIATES OR
    LICENSORS IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT, WHETHER ONLINE OR
    OFFLINE, OF ANY USER OF THE GOOD KARMS PLATFORM AND YOU HEREBY
    RELEASE COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS FROM ANY LIABILITY
    RELATED THERETO. COMPANY AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS WILL NOT
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, INJURY OR DAMAGE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH
    YOUR USE OF THE GOOD KARMS PLATFORM.
    <h4>3. Contract between Clients and Workers</h4>
    You acknowledge and agree that a contract (the “Service Agreement”) is formed when
    you agree on the terms of a Job(s) with another User. The terms of the Service
    Agreement include the terms set forth in this Section 3, the engagement terms
    proposed and accepted on the Good Karms Platform, and any other contractual terms
    accepted by both the Client and the Worker to the extent such terms do not conflict with
    the terms in this Section 3 and do not expand Company’s obligations or restrict
    Company’s rights under this Agreement. You agree that Company is not a party to any
    Service Agreement and the formation of a Service Agreement will not, under any
    circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Company
    and the Worker.
    Where approved in advance by the Client, the Worker is not obligated to personally
    perform the Services. Before any Job(s) services are performed by any assistants,
    helpers, subcontractors or other personnel engaged by the Worker, the Worker shall
    require any such individuals to become registered Workers on the Good Karms Platform
    pursuant to Company policies as described on the Good Karms Platform. The Worker
    assumes full and sole responsibility for the payment of all compensation, benefits and
    expenses of helpers, assistants, subcontractors and/or other personnel, if any, and for
    all required and applicable state and federal income tax withholdings as to the Worker
    and all persons engaged by the Worker in the performance of the Job(s) services.
    The Client shall pay for completed Job(s) services through the PSP (as defined below)
    as indicated on the Good Karms Platform at the rates agreed to in the engagement
    terms. Each party agrees to comply with the Good Karms Best Practices Guide during
    the engagement, performance and completion of a Job(s). Both parties agree to notify
    Company of any disputes prior to negotiation of or filing of any claims and to negotiate
    any dispute informally via Company representatives for at least thirty (30) days before
    initiating any proceeding between the parties.
    <h4>4. Billing and Payment</h4>
    Users of the Good Karms Platform contract for Job(s) directly with other Users.
    Company will not be a party to any contracts for Job(s) or services. Payment for Job(s)
    services through the Good Karms Platform is made directly from the Client to the
    Worker and not by Company.
    Users of the Good Karms Platform will be required to provide their credit card or bank
    account details to Company and the Payment Service Provider retained by Company
    (the “PSP”). Clients will be responsible for paying the invoice for each Job(s) (the
    “Invoice”), which will include if applicable, (i) the pricing terms of the Job(s) agreed with
    and provided by a Worker (“Job(s) Payment”), (ii) any out of pocket expenses agreed
    with and submitted by a Worker in connection with the Job(s), (iii) any tip or gratuity, (iv)
    the service charge Company assesses for the Good Karms Platform, variable based on
    the Job(s) Payment amount, and (v) potential miscellaneous fees.
    Workers may be required to register with the PSP, agree to Terms of Service of the PSP
    and go through a vetting process at the request of the PSP to set up their account with
    the PSP (the “PSP Agreement”). By accepting these Terms of Use, each Worker
    agrees that they have downloaded or printed, and reviewed and agreed to the PSP
    Agreement. Please note that Company is not a party to the PSP Agreement and that
    you, the PSP and any other parties listed in the PSP Agreement are the parties to the
    PSP Agreement and that Company has no obligations or liability to any Worker under
    the PSP Agreement.
    When Client receives confirmation through the Good Karms Platform or via email that a
    Job(s) has been completed, Client automatically authorizes Company to provide Client's
    payment details to the PSP for processing of Job(s) Payment, out of pocket expenses
    owed to Worker, and the service charge and platform fees owed to Company for the use
    of the Good Karms Platform. You may be charged a cancellation fee through the PSP if
    you book a Job(s), but cancel it before it is completed.
    Company reserves the right, in its sole discretion (but not the obligation), upon request
    from Client or Worker or upon notice of any potential fraud, unauthorized charges or
    other misuse of the Good Karms Platform, to (i) place on hold any Job(s) Payment and
    out of pocket expenses, or (ii) refund, provide credits or arrange for the PSP to do so.
    Job(s) Payment and fees must be paid through the PSP as indicated on the Good
    Karms Platform.
    Users of the Good Karms Platform will be liable for any taxes (including VAT, if
    applicable) required to be paid on the Job(s) services provided under the Agreement
    (other than taxes on Company’s income).
    <h4>5. Release</h4>
    The Good Karms Platform is only a venue for connecting Users. Because Company is
    not involved in the actual contact between Users or in the completion of the Job(s), in
    the event that you have a dispute with one or more Users, you release Company and its
    affiliates (and their respective officers, directors, agents, investors, subsidiaries, and
    employees) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of
    every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and
    undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.
    COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY LIABILITY THAT MAY ARISE BETWEEN
    USERS OF ITS GOOD KARMS PLATFORM. Company has no liability with respect to
    disputes between Users.
    <h4>6. Public Areas; Acceptable Use</h4>
    The Good Karms Platform may contain profiles, email systems, blogs, message boards,
    applications, job(s) postings, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities and/or
    other message or communication facilities (“Public Areas”) that allow Users to
    communicate with other Users. You may only use such community areas to send and

    suspension, and termination or suspension will be effective immediately upon delivery
    of such notice.
    If Company terminates or suspends your right to use the Good Karms Platform as a
    Client for a User Breach, you will not be entitled to any refund of unused balance in your
    account, and you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your
    name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be

    Even after your right to use the Good Karms Platform is terminated or suspended, this

    Company reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or

    you have advanced to Company (if any), Company is not liable to you for any

    Company has the right to restrict anyone from completing registration as a Worker if
    Company believes such person may threaten the safety and integrity of the Good
    Karms Platform, or if, in Company’s discretion, such restriction is necessary to address
    any other reasonable business concern.
    You may terminate this Agreement at any time by ceasing all use of the Good Karms
    Platform. All sections which by their nature should survive the expiration or termination
    of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect subsequent to and
    notwithstanding the expiration or termination of this Agreement.
    <h4>8. Account, Password, Security and Mobile Phone Use</h4>
    You must register with Company and create an account to use the Good Karms
    Platform. You are the sole authorized user of your account. You are responsible for
    maintaining the confidentiality of any password and account number provided by you or
    Company for accessing the Good Karms Platform. You are solely and fully responsible
    for all activities that occur under your password or account. Company has no control
    over the use of any User's account and expressly disclaims any liability derived
    therefrom. Should you suspect that any unauthorized party may be using your password
    or account or you suspect any other breach of security, you will contact Company
    immediately.

    us by modifying your account settings on the Site or Company’s mobile application.
    <h4>9. Your Information and Likeness</h4>
    “Your Information” is defined as any information and materials you provide to Company
    or other Users in connection with your registration for and use of the Good Karms
    Platform, including without limitation that posted or transmitted for use in Public Areas.
    You are solely responsible for Your Information, and we act merely as a passive conduit
    for your online distribution and publication of Your Information. The information and
    materials described in this Section, as provided by each User, is collectively referred to
    herein as “User Generated Content.”
    You hereby represent and warrant to Company that Your Information (a) will not be
    false, inaccurate, incomplete or misleading; (b) will not be fraudulent or involve the sale
    of counterfeit or stolen items; (c) will not infringe any third party's copyright, patent,

    false advertising); (e) will not be defamatory, libelous, unlawfully threatening, or
    unlawfully harassing; (f) will not be obscene or contain child pornography or be harmful

    cancelbots or other computer programming routines that are intended to damage,

    personal information; and (h) will not create liability for Company or cause Company to
    lose (in whole or in part) the services of its ISPs or other partners or suppliers.
    The Good Karms Platform hosts User Generated Content relating to reviews and
    ratings of specific Workers (“Feedback”). Such Feedback is such User’s opinion and
    not the opinion of Company, has not been verified or approved by Company and each
    Client should undertake their own research to be satisfied that a specific Worker is the
    right person for a Job(s). You agree that Company is not liable for any Feedback or
    other User Generated Content. Company encourages each User to give objective,
    constructive and honest Feedback about the other Users with whom they have
    transacted. Company does not investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or
    reliability but may do so if a User requests that Company do so.
    You hereby grant Company a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royaltyfree,
    sublicensable (through multiple tiers) right to exercise all copyright, publicity rights,
    and any other rights you have in Your Information, in any media now known or not
    currently known in order to perform and improve upon the Good Karms Platform.
    Each Worker who provides to Company any videotape, film, record, photograph, voice,
    or all related instrumental, musical, or other sound effects, in exchange for the right to
    use the Good Karms Platform, hereby irrevocably grants to Company the non-exclusive,
    fully-paid, royalty-free, transferable, sublicensable, worldwide, unrestricted, and
    perpetual right to:
    • Use any videotape, film, record or photograph that such Worker provides to
    Company, and use, reproduce, modify, or creative derivatives of such Worker
    picture, silhouette and other reproductions of their physical likeness (as the same
    may appear in any still camera photograph and/or motion picture film or video)
    (collectively the “Physical Likeness”), in and in connection with the exhibition,
    distribution, display, performance, transmission, broadcasting on any and all
    media, including, without limitation, the internet, of any videos or images of such
    Worker in connection with the Good Karms Platform.
    • Reproduce in all media any recordings of such Worker’s voice, and all related
    instrumental, musical, or other sound effects (collectively, the “Voice”), made in
    connection with the Good Karms Platform.
    • Use, and permit to be used, such Worker’s Physical Likeness and Voice in the
    advertising, marketing, and/or publicizing of the Good Karms Platform in any
    media.

    the Good Karms Platform.
    Each Worker hereby waives all rights and releases Company from, and shall neither
    sue nor bring any proceeding against any such parties for, any claim or cause of action,
    whether now known or unknown, for defamation, invasion of right to privacy, publicity or
    personality or any similar matter, or based upon or relating to the use and exploitation of
    such Worker’s identity, likeness or voice in connection with the Good Karms Platform.
    Each Worker acknowledges that Company shall not owe any financial or other
    remuneration for using the recordings provided hereunder by such Worker, either for
    initial or subsequent transmission or playback, and further acknowledges that Company
    is not responsible for any expense or liability incurred as a result of such Worker’s
    recordings or participation in any recordings, including any loss of such recording data.
    <h4>10. Links to Other Websites</h4>
    The Good Karms Platform may contain links (such as hyperlinks) to third-party
    websites. Such links do not constitute the endorsement by Company of those sites or
    their content. They are provided as an information service, for reference and
    convenience only. Company does not control any such sites, and is not responsible for
    their (1) availability or accuracy, or (2) content, advertising, or products or services. The
    existence of links on the Good Karms Platform to such websites (including without
    limitation external websites that are framed by the Good Karms Platform as well as any
    advertisements displayed in connection therewith) does not mean that Company
    endorses any of the material on such websites, or has any association with their
    operators. It is your responsibility to evaluate the content and usefulness of the
    information obtained from other sites.
    The use of any website controlled, owned or operated by third parties is governed by
    the terms and conditions of use and privacy policies for those websites, and not by
    Company's Terms of Service or Privacy Policy. You access such third-party websites at
    your own risk. Company expressly disclaims any liability arising in connection with your
    use and/or viewing of any websites or other material associated with links that may
    appear on the Good Karms Platform. You hereby agree to hold Company harmless from
    any liability that may result from the use of links that may appear on the Good Karms
    Platform.
    As part of the functionality of the Good Karms Platform, you may link your account with
    online accounts you may have with third party service providers (such as Facebook)
    (each such account, a “Third Party Account”) by either: (i) providing your Third Party
    Account login information through the Good Karms Platform; or (ii) allowing Company to
    access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and
